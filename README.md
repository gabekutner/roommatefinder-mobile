# Local Development
These instructions should get you setup ready to work on DormParty ðŸš€

## Getting Started
1. Install `nvm` then `node` & `npm`: `brew install nvm && nvm install`
2. Install `watchman`: `brew install watchman`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run iOS Pod Install: `npx pod-install ios`

> The current build is made for IOS, Android compatibility is being worked on.

## Running the IOS app ðŸ“±
- If you haven't already, install Xcode tools and make sure to install the optional "IOS-Platform" package as well. This could take awhile.
  - After installation, check in System Settings that there's no update for Xcode. Otherwise, you may encounter vague issues.
- To install the iOS dependencies, run: `npm install && npm run pod-install`.
- To run on a **Development Simulator**: `npm run ios`.

> In development, I've been using the `iPhone SE` and/or `iPhone 15 Pro Max`. There's no difference between which one you choose other than size.


# Contributing
Thanks for taking the time, first of all! Second, contributing is really simple. Follow the installation steps and create a pull request. As far as finding issues to work on, issues with the `FirstIssue` label are good for starters.

# Contact
If you run into an issue, have a question, or anything else create a discussion or issue and @ me. I'm very active and will see your post the same day you post it.

# Important
The current repository has a lot of deprecated code in it. Most of the components in the src/components aren't being used and the src/core library is half moved to the libs folder. Nothing big but the repository is being cleaned while also being improved so make sure you don't delete anything that's being used or use something that isn't used anywhere else (going to be deleted). 

If you're interested in helping out with this, contact me I will respond very quickly. Thank you!
