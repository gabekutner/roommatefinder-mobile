# Getting Started
### üç¥ Fork and Clone the Repo

First, you need to fork the `roommatefinder-mobile` repo. You can do this by clicking the Fork button on the top right corner of the repo. If you are new to forking, please watch this [YouTube Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8suY-Osn8Q) to get started.

Once forked, you can clone the repo by clicking the `Clone or Download` button on the top right corner of the forked repo. 

Please change the directory after cloning the repository using the `cd <folder-name>` command.

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Running the Development Server
To run the development server, make sure you have the following dependencies set up on your computer:

1. Install `nvm` then `node` & `npm`: `brew install nvm && nvm install`
2. Install `watchman`: `brew install watchman`
* If you haven't already, install Xcode tools and make sure to install the optional "IOS-Platform" package as well. This could take awhile.
  * After installation, check in System Settings that there's no update for Xcode. Otherwise, you may encounter vague issues.
 
After, install package dependencies using `npm`.
```bash
npm i
```

Then run the CocoaPods install.
```bash
npx pod-install
```

Before you run the `npm start` you have to configure and run the backend api. Don't worry this is super easy and requires no knowledge of Python or Django Rest to get this going. I've already wrote about how to do that in the backend's README, so here's that repo again: https://github.com/gabekutner/roommatefinder-backend.

To connect to the backend api once you have it up and running go to the `src/constants/apiConstants.ts` file and change the `const ADDRESS = "10.0.0.49:8000";` to the ip address of you're computer. 

And finally, run the project!
```bash
npm start
```

These instructions should get you set up ready to work on Dorm Party üéâ
