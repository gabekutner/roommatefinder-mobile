# Local Development

These instructions should get you setup ready to work on RoommateFinder ðŸš€

## Getting Started

1. Install `nvm` then `node` & `npm`: `brew install nvm && nvm install`
2. Install `watchman`: `brew install watchman`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run iOS Pod Install: `npx pod-install ios`

> The current build is made for IOS, Android compatibility is being worked on.

## Running the IOS app ðŸ“±

- If you haven't already, install Xcode tools and make sure to install the optional "IOS-Platform" package as well. This could take awhile.
  - After installation, check in System Settings that there's no update for Xcode. Otherwise, you may encounter vague issues.
- To install the iOS dependencies, run: `npm install && npm run pod-install`.
- To run on a **Development Simulator**: `npm run ios`.

> In development, I've been using the `iPhone SE` and/or `iPhone 15 Pro Max`. There's no difference between which one you choose other than size.

## Directory Structure

Almost all the code is inside the `src` folder, inside it there's some organization, we chose to name directories that are created to house a collection of items in plural form and using camelCase (eg: views, libs, etc), the main ones we have for now are:

* components: React native components that are re-used in several places.
* libs: Library classes/functions, these are not React native components (ie: they are not UI)
* views: These are components that define screens in the app. The naming convention for views are `<name>View`.
