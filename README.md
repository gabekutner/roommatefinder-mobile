# Local Development
### üç¥ Fork and Clone the Repo

First, yu need to fork the `roommatefinder-mobile` repo. You can do this by clicking the Fork button on the top right corner of the repo. If you are new to forking, please watch this [YouTube Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8suY-Osn8Q) to get started.

Once forked, you can clone the repo by clicking the `Clone or Download` button on the top right corner of the forked repo. 

Please change the directory after cloning the repository using the `cd <folder-name>` command.

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Running the Development Server
To run the development server, make sure you have to have the following dependencies set up on your machine:

1. Install `nvm` then `node` & `npm`: `brew install nvm && nvm install`
2. Install `watchman`: `brew install watchman`
* If you haven't already, install Xcode tools and make sure to install the optional "IOS-Platform" package as well. This could take awhile.
  * After installation, check in System Settings that there's no update for Xcode. Otherwise, you may encounter vague issues.
 
After, install package dependencies using `npm`.
```bash
npm i
```

Then run the CocoaPods install.
```bash
npx pod-install
```

To connect to the backend api, which you should have running for easier development (see how [**here**](https://github.com/gabekutner/roommatefinder-backend/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#local-development), go to the `src/constants/apiConstants.ts` file and change the `const ADDRESS = "10.0.0.49:8000";` to whatever the address is of the api you're running.  

Finally, run the project.
```bash
npm start
```

These instructions should get you set up ready to work on Dorm Party üéâ
